   <h1>The Situation of Sitio Bebe</h1>
    <p>Sitio Bebe is a town where there is a shortage of drinking water, because the town is not near<br>
     any natural sources of water. Even though balon’s or water are open, this still makes drinkable water<br>
     scarce, and that they have to boil the water before drinking it.</p>

     <img src="data.png">

     <p>Based on the table, the percentage of cases in Sitio Bebe of (acute respiratory infection(59%),<br> 
     acute lower respiratory tract infection(6%), and hypertension(5.5%)), are higher than the cases<br> 
     of Central Luzon which even has a larger population than Sitio Bebe, cases of common diseases<br> 
     of Sitio Bebe in Central Luzon: acute respiratory infection(48.%), acute lower respiratory tract<br> 
     infection(6% ), and hypertension(5.5%). One of the reasons for having common diseases in Sitio<br> 
     Bebe is that usually work in the town is mining or factory work. In mining, the diseases can be<br>
     caused by the coal or other 'ores' that they inhale that harms their respiratory system, it can<br>
     also be the factory because of the smoke it emits from the engine, and that you are in an <br>
     enclosed area or building. And if a person gets one of the diseases, the process of consulting<br>
     with a doctor would be slow, sure there are training centers but there aren’t even colleges that<br> 
     would have health professional courses, even the colleges are from other cities, this would lead<br>
     to short staff in hospitals or clinics</p>

  <h1>Our Solution</h1>
  <p>Our Group decided to create a fundraising concert to gain money to help the residents of Sitio Bebe, and informed
     our audience via facebook, or youtube through an educational video.</p></div>

 <h3>Who are the people that we need?</h3>
 <div id="TargetAudience">
  <div id="SchoolHeads"><p>School heads<br>
  25% of the profited funds from the concert would fund colleges that will support health professional courses.
  </p></div>

  <div id="Residents"><p>The Residents of Sitio Bebe<br>
  So that they can be aware of the diseases that they could acquire, 50% of the profit would go to the barangay to assist them, and
  25% of the profit would go to clean water providers so that they wouldn’t need to boil the water from water pumps.
  </p></div>
